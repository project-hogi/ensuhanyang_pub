										ㆍCrowd funding is a compound term of English word ‘crowd’ that means mass of people and ‘funding’ that means financing. It refers to an act of
										creative &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;entrepreneurs or fund demanders raising funds from  many and unspecified small investors through crowd funding brokerages who

										ㆍUnlike indirect finance through financial intermediaries (e.g. banks), crowd funding is based on the development of IT technology in which
										finance suppliers &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;connected via online such as the Internet have direct transactions through crowd funding platforms as a form of P2P
										(peer to peer) finance.
